title: "Cerco BRDF - Understanding multi-angular reflectance patterns in a <em>Cercospora beticola</em> trial."
excerpt: "Giuseppe Quaratiello [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giuseppe-Quaratiello-3) is exploring the diurnal variability of leaf angle distribution in a cercospora/sugar beet variety trial. The goal is to understand the multi-angular reflectance patterns that are caused by diseased and healthy sugar beet plants and to find optimal flight missions to describe these patterns (e.g., by using bidirectional reflectance distribution functions). <br/><img src='/images/quaratiello.jpg'>"
