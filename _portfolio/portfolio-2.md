title: "ON Cerco - Understanding multi-angular reflectance patterns in a <em>Cercospora beticola</em> trial."
excerpt: "In 2024, the IfZ is looking for a M.Sc. student to explore the diurnal variability of leaf angle in a cercospora/sugar beet variety trial. The goal is to understand the dynamics of angular leaf movement throughout multiple days and link this to weather parameters. Different sugar beet cultivars, inoculated with *Cercospora beticola* and healthy plants will be assessed. Eventually, the results will be used to link them to aerial reflectance data and evaluate to what extent diurnal variability in LAD in affecting spectral signals."
