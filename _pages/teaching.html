**Digital Technologies in Crop Production**

Agricultural Sciences (M.Sc.), Georg-August-Universit√§t Goettingen, Agricultural Sciences, 2023

In this module, students are introduced to selected digital technologies and their technical environment for use in crop production systems. In a second block of the course, the different sensors are in the foreground: environmental sensors / optical sensors such as RGB, multi- and hyperspectral technologies / 3D technologies, chlorophyll fluorescence and thermography / acoustic sensors and force measurement / remote sensing and satellites. In a third block of the lecture, practical applications are presented, some of which are already in use: Detection of the development of a crop and abiotic stress, case studies on the detection of plant diseases by means of optical sensors and on yield parameters and machine sensors with field applications (vehicle- or airborne). Applications in arable, fruit and vegetable production are considered.
