<h2>ON-Cerco (Active)</h2>

The standard view when using drones is looking straight down (nadir). Oblique viewing angles allow adding more information that can be used for plant disease incidence and severity estimates.

<h2>Remotely sensed leaf area index can improve mechanistic *Cercospora beticola* epidemiological models for disease predictions (Active)</h2>

Plant disease epidemiological models, empirical and mechanistic, assist with disease management decisions by providing a prediction of plant disease epidemics. 
Yet, adoption of predictive models in integrated crop protection can be low as available decision support systems require validation, in-field scouting by growers and 
agronomists and, from time to time, model parameter reviews. This project investigates, whether remote sensing technologies and automation strategies can assist in this 
process and ease adoption.

<h2>M.Sc. Research (Active) - Accuracy assessment for spot-spraying robots.</h2>
Teresa Starck evaluated the accuracy and practicability of spot-spraying robots in maize and sugar beet.

<h2>M.Sc. Research (Active) - Digital technologies for Virus Yellows phenotyping in sugar beet across spatial scales.</h2>
Nathan Okole is investigating whether optical sensors at close-range and from uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) can be used for phenotyping Virus Yellows in sugar beet.

<h2>B.Sc. Research (Alumni) - Can we predict the susceptibility to myrtle rust with the help of physical leaf traits?</h2>
Larissa Krey collected, and statistically associated, various - biologically relevant - plant functional traits to the pathosystem Austropuccinia psidii on Backhousia citridora.
