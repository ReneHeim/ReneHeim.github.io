<h2>M.Sc. Research (Active) - Accuracy assessment for spot-spraying robots.</h2>
Teresa Starck evaluated the accuracy and practicability of spot-spraying robots in maize and sugar beet.

<h2>M.Sc. Research (Active) - Digital technologies for Virus Yellows phenotyping in sugar beet across spatial scales.</h2>
Nathan Okole is investigating whether optical sensors at close-range and from uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) can be used for phenotyping Virus Yellows in sugar beet.

<h2>B.Sc. Research (Alumni) - Can we predict the susceptibility to myrtle rust with the help of physical leaf traits?</h2>
Larissa Krey collected, and statistically associated, various - biologically relevant - plant functional traits to the pathosystem Austropuccinia psidii on Backhousia citridora.
