## ON-Cerco
The standard view when using drones is looking straight down (nadir). Oblique viewing angles allow adding more information that can be used for plant disease incidence and severity estimates. 
## M.Sc. Research (Active) - Accuracy assessment for spot-spraying robots.
Teresa Starck evaluated the accuracy and practicability of spot-spraying robots in maize and sugar beet.
## M.Sc. Research (Active) - Digital technologies for Virus Yellows phenotyping in sugar beet across spatial scales.
Nathan Okole is investigating whether optical sensors at close-range and from uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) can be used for phenotyping Virus Yellows in sugar beet.
##  B.Sc. Research (Alumni) - Can we predict the susceptibility to myrtle rust with the help of physical leaf traits?
Larissa Krey collected, and statistically associated, various - biologically relevant - plant functional traits to the pathosystem Austropuccinia psidii on Backhousia citridora.
