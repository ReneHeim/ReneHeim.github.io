<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2>ON-Cerco (Active)</h2>

The standard view when using drones is looking straight down (nadir). Oblique viewing angles allow adding more information that can be used for plant disease incidence and 
severity estimates.

<h2>Remotely sensed leaf area index can improve mechanistic <i>Cercospora beticola</i> epidemiological models for disease predictions (Active)</h2>

Plant disease epidemiological models, empirical and mechanistic, assist with disease management decisions by providing a prediction of plant disease epidemics. 
Yet, adoption of predictive models in integrated crop protection can be low as available decision support systems require validation, in-field scouting by growers and 
agronomists and, from time to time, model parameter reviews. This project investigates, whether remote sensing technologies and automation strategies can assist in this 
process and ease adoption.

<h2> High interval measurement of leaf angle dynamics using stereo vision (Completed, [published](https://reneheim.github.io/publications/))</h2>

Leaf inclination angles (LIA) are crucial for regulating various processes within the plant carbon–water–energy nexus. In agriculture, these processes 
include photosynthesis, leaf temperature, plant growth, and the microclimate within the canopy. Despite its significance, LIA remains one of the most 
understudied plant functional traits due to the difficulty of measuring it accurately, particularly at short temporal intervals. In optical remote sensing, 
LIA is a key factor influencing spectral variability, which directly impacts the robustness of empirical models. Together with Frederik Hennecke, a data science 
student at the University of Göttingen, we developed a novel and automated approach to capture 3D point clouds of small crops (e.g., sugar beet), enabling precise determination of LIA from the generated data. Our system, 
controlled by publicly available code, and therefore adhering to FAIR principles and open software standards, allows for customizable capture intervals and 
positions. The method was validated using a 3D-printed sugar beet model with known LIA, demonstrating its potential for advancing plant trait studies.

The FarmBot Genesis v1.6 was upgraded with a Raspberry Pi (A) to control the position (e.g., yellow dots) and interval of image capture events of an  
Intel RealSense D405 (B) depth camera. The camera was mounted at the bottom of the z-axis extrusion, while the associated Raspberry Pi was mounted above 
the electronic box on the gantry of the FarmBot. The camera generated 3-dimensional point clouds that served as a source for LIA retrieval. The accuracy of 
LIA measurement was validated with a 3D-printed plant with known LIA´s. 

<h2>Evaluating spot-spraying systems in sugar beet (Completed)</h2>

Across multiple field site in northern Germany, it is investigated whether spot spraying can contribute to herbicide savings in sugar beet cultivation.
