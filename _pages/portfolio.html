<h2>ON-Cerco (Active)</h2>

The standard view when using drones is looking straight down (nadir). Oblique viewing angles allow adding more information that can be used for plant disease incidence and 
severity estimates.

<h2>Remotely sensed leaf area index can improve mechanistic <i>Cercospora beticola</i> epidemiological models for disease predictions (Active)</h2>

Plant disease epidemiological models, empirical and mechanistic, assist with disease management decisions by providing a prediction of plant disease epidemics. 
Yet, adoption of predictive models in integrated crop protection can be low as available decision support systems require validation, in-field scouting by growers and 
agronomists and, from time to time, model parameter reviews. This project investigates, whether remote sensing technologies and automation strategies can assist in this 
process and ease adoption.

<h2> High interval measurement of leaf angle dynamics using stereo vision (Active)</h2>

Leaf inclination angles (LIA) are crucial for regulating various processes within the plant carbon–water–energy nexus. In agriculture, these processes include photosynthesis, leaf temperature, plant growth, and the microclimate within the canopy. Despite its significance, LIA remains one of the most understudied plant functional traits due to the difficulty of measuring it accurately, particularly at short temporal intervals. In optical remote sensing, LIA is a key factor influencing spectral variability, which directly impacts the robustness of empirical models. To address this gap, we propose a novel, automated approach to capture 3D point clouds of small crops (e.g., sugar beet), enabling precise determination of LIA from the generated data. Our system, controlled by publicly available code, and therefore adhering to FAIR principles and open software standards, allows for customizable capture intervals and positions. 
The method was validated using a 3D-printed sugar beet model with known LIA, demonstrating its potential for advancing plant trait studies.

<h2>Evaluating spot-spraying systems in sugar beet (Completed)</h2>

Across multiple field site in northern Germany, it is investigated whether spot spraying can contribute to herbicide savings in sugar beet cultivation.

traits. Andrés is enrolled in the M.Sc. program <i>Sustainable International Agriculture</i> at the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen.

<h2>M.Sc. Research (Alumni) - Digital technologies for Virus Yellows phenotyping in sugar beet across spatial scales.</h2>
Nathan Okole is investigating whether optical sensors at close-range and from uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) can be used for phenotyping Virus Yellows in sugar beet.
Nathan is enrolled in the M.Sc. program <i>Crop Protection</i> at the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen.

<h2>M.Sc. Research (Alumni) - Accuracy assessment for spot-spraying systems.</h2>
Teresa Starck assessed the precision and practicability of a spot-spraying system for use in maize and sugar beet crops. After her thesis, Teresa accepted a position at Xarvio - BASF Digital Farming GmbH.
