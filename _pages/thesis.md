If you are interested in discussion thesis topics, feel free to [book a meeting](https://reneheim.github.io/contact/) and visit me. I am trying to keep my institutional homepage up-to-date. There you can find open calls for thesis work.  Apart from these open calls, we can discuss topics within the scope of: 

- Computational Geography (Python, R and Julia)
- Machine Learning
- Agro-Ecosystem Research
- Remote Sensing of Plant Stress
- Open and Reproducible Research in Agro-Ecosystem Research
- Urban Remote Sensing
