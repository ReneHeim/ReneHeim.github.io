- How do drone flight patterns affect the coverage of multi-angular views and the battery costs? (**M.Sc.**)
- Can we classify mycological herbaria using hyperspectral digitalisation? (**M.Sc.**)
- How does the open-source software [ReflectDetect](https://github.com/reflectdetect/reflectdetect) affect multispectral reflectance properties compared to standard radiometric calibration procedures? (**M.Sc.**)
- Can we quantify multi-seasonal in-field spatial heterogeneity using Sentinel 2 super-resolution data? (**B.Sc. and M.Sc.**)
- Exploring advantages and disadvantes of drone-derived multiangular reflectance data (**B.Sc.**)
- Can hedgerows function as environmental filters for pests and pathogens? (**M.Sc.**)
- To what extent do agroecosystem landscape structure (what are useful metrics?) differ between Germany (Lower Saxony) and South Africa? (**B.Sc. and M.Sc.**)
