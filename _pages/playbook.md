This page is a living collection of resources for students and early career researchers to find tools that support each step of their research process while still following the logic of the scientific method.These are tools that work for me, and I am always curious about new solutions. Please create a pull request if you would like to add something. 

## 1. Getting into a new topic and forming ideas

#### How to find and manage literature (search strategies, reference managers).
- Collecting Papers: [Research Rabbit]
- Manage Papers: [Zotero]

## 2. Fieldwork

#### Resources for planning field sampling (reference data) and remote sensing missions 

- Experimental and sampling design -> [FielDHub](https://didiermurillof.github.io/FielDHub/index.html)
