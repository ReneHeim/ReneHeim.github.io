My studies in [Bioengineering](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/) and [Plant Ecology](https://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/en/einrichtungen/ipm.html) shaped my interest in inter-disciplinary research. My international research experience in [Valencia](https://www.uv.es/), [Sydney](https://www.mq.edu.au/), [Gainesville](https://www.eng.ufl.edu/), [Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za/fabi), and [Ghent](https://www.ugent.be/bw/plants-and-crops/en) taught me that the most vexing challenges human society faces cannot be solved unilaterally. 

My work centers on methodologically sound knowledge transfer between remote sensing applications and plant science, employing machine learning techniques for image processing and data analysis tasks in both R and Python. As an interdisciplinary researcher, I leverage remote sensing technologies across multiple spatial and temporal scales to identify win-win solutions for sustainable land use, agricultural management, and environmental stewardship.<br> 

My interests extend to understanding structural and biochemical plant stress responses and their manifestation in remote sensing data, as well as developing computational approaches to enhance data resolution and analytical precision. Looking ahead, I aim to expand this methodological toolkit into landscape epidemiology, exploring how advanced image analysis can improve plant disease monitoring and management at ecosystem levels.
