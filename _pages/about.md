I am a plant ecologist and remote sensing scientist working at the interface of ecology, agriculture and plant disease. Trained in bioengineering [HAW Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/bachelor-biotechnologie) and plant ecology [Universität Hamburg](https://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/en/einrichtungen/ipm.html), with research stays in [Valencia](https://www.uv.es/), [Sydney](https://www.mq.edu.au/), [Gainesville](https://www.eng.ufl.edu/), [Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za/fabi) and [Ghent](https://www.ugent.be/bw/plants-and-crops/en), I am curious about the effects of plant stress and plant–pathogen-environment interactions and how to monitor and manage effects across scales using imaging sensors, field experiments and data‑driven models.

My research combines UAV, close‑range and satellite remote sensing with machine learning in R and Python to extract trait‑related signals, detect disease and quantify stress in crops, forests and the transition zones in agroecosystems. A central goal is to identify co-benefits at the interface of natural and cultivated landscapes that support both sustainable agriculture and resilient ecosystems.

For more details on my research and to discuss collaboration and thesis supervision, please contact me (rene.heim@uni-goettingen.de).
