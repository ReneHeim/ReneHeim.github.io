My studies in Bioengineering and Plant Ecology shaped my interest in inter-disciplinary research. I believe that the most vexing challenges human society faces cannot be solved unilaterally. A key interest is transferring and developing methods in optical remote sensing and applying them in digital disease detection and precision agriculture. With my research, I am hoping to optimize agricultural practices for securing a responsible and healthy food production while mitigating their environmental impact.

For more details on my research and to discuss collaboration and thesis supervision, please contact me. I am currently a principal investigator hosted by the [IfZ](https://ifz-goettingen.de) and the [Stachniss Lab for Photogrammetry & Robotics](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/index.html) at the University of Bonn.
